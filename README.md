# Note
I was unable to find the property 'land_success' or 'launch_landing' in the api provided.
Hence, that field is coming as blank in all the cards.

# Tech Stack
1. Angular version 8.3.12.
2. TypeScript
3. HTML5
4. SCSS

# Approach
1. For server side rending : Angular Universal
2. For responsive layout : Media Queries
    For making the layout compatible with mobiles, tablets & desktop, media queries have been used to set the width of columns as per the resolution of devices.
